Python code to simulate the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Created by @eightyfivepoint 

The main script to run simulations can be found in WorldCup2018Sim.py. From the command line execute:

> python WorldCup2018Sim.py

to run simulations. It requires numpy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib to run (four very common python packages).

In the script you can set the number of simulation iterations (Nsims), turn on/off detailed output (match results and group tables, verbose), and save plots to file (savePlots).

A detailed description of the simulation methodology can be found here:

The input file WorldCup2018_groups.csv contains information on the teams, groups, seeds, elo scores and penalty strengths.
